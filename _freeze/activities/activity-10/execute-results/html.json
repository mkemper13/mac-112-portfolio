Specifically, we want a dataset with 3 columns and a first few rows that look something like this:\n\n| Subject | day | reaction_time |\n|--------:|----:|--------------:|\n|     308 |   0 |        249.56 |\n|     308 |   1 |        258.70 |\n|     308 |   2 |        250.80 |\n\n#### Part a {.unnumbered}\n\nUse `pivot_longer()` to create the long-format dataset above. Show the first 3 lines (`head(3)`), which should be *similar* to those above.

This will look goofy no matter what you do. Why? HINT: look back at `head(sleep_long)`. What class or type of variables are `Subject` and `day`?

For example:\n\n-   What's the general relationship between reaction time and sleep?\n\nas sleep increases, so does reaction time \n-   Is this the same for everybody? What differs?\nFor some it tends to be worse than others with less sleep, others have slower or faster reaction time in general. \n\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\n### Exercise 4: Pivot wider {.unnumbered}\n\nMake the data *wide* again, with each day becoming its own column.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsleep_long |>\n  pivot_wider(names_from = day, values_from = reaction_time) |>\n  head()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 11\n  Subject   `0`   `1`   `2`   `3`   `4`   `5`   `6`   `7`   `8`   `9`\n  <fct>   <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>\n1 308      250.  259.  251.  321.  357.  415.  382.  290.  431.  466.\n2 309      223.  205.  203.  205.  208.  216.  214.  218.  224.  237.\n3 310      199.  194.  234.  233.  229.  220.  235.  256.  261.  248.\n4 330      322.  300.  284.  285.  286.  298.  280.  318.  305.  354.\n5 331      288.  285   302.  320.  316.  293.  290.  335.  294.  372.\n6 332      235.  243.  273.  310.  317.  310   454.  347.  330.  254.\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n#### Part a {.unnumbered}\n\nAdjust the code below.

It includes a list of every guest to ever appear on Jon Stewart's The Daily Show, a \"late-night talk and satirical news\" program (per Wikipedia). Check out the dataset and note that when multiple people appeared together, each person receives their own line:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(fivethirtyeight)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nSome larger datasets need to be installed separately, like senators and\nhouse_district_forecast.

When you do, use `values_fill = 0` to replace NA values with 0.\n-   Arrange, then and keep the top 15.\n\n#### Part c {.unnumbered}\n\nLet's recreate the first figure from [the article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/every-guest-jon-stewart-ever-had-on-the-daily-show/). This groups all guests into 3 broader occupational categories.

And get rid of any rows missing information on `broad_group`. You'll learn the code soon! For now, just run this chunk:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot_data <- daily |> \n  mutate(broad_group = case_when(\n    group %in% c(\"Acting\", \"Athletics\", \"Comedy\", \"Musician\") ~ \"Acting, Comedy & Music\",\n    group %in% c(\"Media\", \"media\", \"Science\", \"Academic\", \"Consultant\", \"Clergy\") ~ \"Media\",\n    group %in% c(\"Politician\", \"Political Aide\", \"Government\", \"Military\", \"Business\", \"Advocacy\") ~ \"Government and Politics\",\n    .default = NA\n  )) |> \n  filter(!is.na(broad_group))\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow, using the `broad_group` variable in `plot_data`, recreate the graphic from the article, with three different lines showing the fraction of guests in each group over time. Note: You'll have to wrangle the data first.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n",
