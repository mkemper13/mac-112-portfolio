```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
education <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/sat.csv")
head(education)
```
```{r}
#Exercise 1
#part a)
ggplot(education, aes(x = sat)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

```{r}
#part b) Sat scores range from roughly below 900 to 1100. It appears that a lot of people have scored in the 900 range and then again from 1000-1100. This shape in non-normal with a big gap between 900 and 1000. 

```

```{r}
#Exercise 2
#part a)
ggplot(education, aes(y = expend, x = sat)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

```
```{r}
ggplot(education, aes(y = salary, x = sat)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```
```{r}
#part b)
#Expend and sat scores seem to have a negative relationship, as sat scores increase, expenditures seem to go down. This surprises me. I was thinking it would be the opposite. 
```

```{r}
#Exercise 3
ggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = salary, color = expend)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```
```{r}
#Exercise 4
ggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = salary, color = cut(expend, 3))) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = "lm")
```
States with lower salaries and expenditures tend to have higher SAT scores.

```{r}
#Exercise 5
#Part a
ggplot(education, aes(x = fracCat)) + 
  geom_bar()
```
```{r}
#Part b
ggplot(education, aes(x = sat, fill = fracCat)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5)
```

The more students in a state that take the SAT, the lower the average scores tend to be. This is probably related to self-selection.

```{r}
#Part c
ggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = expend, color = fracCat)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```
When we control for the fraction of students that take the SAT, SAT scores increase with expenditure.


Part d
Student participation tends to be lower among states with lower expenditures (which are likely also the states with higher ed institutions that havenâ€™t historically required the SAT). Those same states tend to have higher SAT scores because of the self-selection of who participates.
