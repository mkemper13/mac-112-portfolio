### Activity 7

### Exercise 1: Professionalism {.unnumbered}

Let's examine weather in 3 Australian locations.

```{r echo = FALSE}
# Load tidyverse package for plotting and wrangling
library(tidyverse)

# Import the data
weather <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/weather_3_locations.csv") |> 
  mutate(date = as.Date(date))
```

The following plot is fine for things like homework or just playing around. But we'll make it more "professional" looking below.

```{r}
ggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am, color = location)) + 
  geom_point()
```

#### Part a {.unnumbered}

Replace A, B, C, and D in the code below to:

-   Add a short, but descriptive title. Under 10 words.
-   Change the x- and y-axis labels, currently just the names of the variables in the dataset. These should be short and include units.
-   Change the legend title to "Location" (just for practice, not because it's better than "location").

```{r}
ggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am, color = location)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(x = "Temperature at 9am in Celsius", y = "Temperature at 3pm in Celsius", title = "Weather in 3 Australian Locations", color = "Location")  
```

#### Part b {.unnumbered}

When we're including our plot in an article, paper, book, or other similar outlet, we should (and are expected to) provide a more descriptive figure caption. Typically, this is *instead* of a title and is more descriptive of what exactly is being plotted.

-   Add a figure caption in the top of the chunk.
-   Include your x-axis, y-axis, and legend labels from Part a.
-   Render your Rmd and check out how the figure caption appears.

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Looking at the predicted weather outcome for temperature at 3pm based on the temp at 9am on that day. Temperatures are meausred in celsius."

ggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am, color = location)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(x = "Temperature at 9am in Celsius", y = "Temperature at 3pm in Celsius", color = "Location")  
```

\
\
\
\

### Exercise 2: Accessibility {.unnumbered}

Let's now make a graphic more accessible.

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Density plots of 3pm temperatures in 3 Australian locations."
#| fig-alt: "Density plots of predicted 3pm temperatures based off of 9am temperatures from that day in each location of Hobart, Uluru, and Wollongong, Australia. The most important takeway from this plot is that Uluru had the highest average predicted 3pm temperature and the greatest variability in temps whereas Wollongong had the least variability in tempature ranges."

ggplot(weather, aes(x = temp3pm, fill = location)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + 
  labs(x = "3pm temperature (Celsius)")  
```

#### Part a {.unnumbered}

Let's add some alt text that can be picked up by screen readers. This is a [great resource on writing alt text for data viz](https://medium.com/nightingale/writing-alt-text-for-data-visualization-2a218ef43f81). In short, whereas figure captions are quick descriptions which assume that the viz is accessible, alt text is a longer description which assumes the viz is not accessible. Alt text should concisely articulate:

-   What your visualization is (e.g. a density plot of 3pm temperatures in Hobart, Uluru, and Wollongong, Australia).
-   A 1-sentence description of the most important *takeaway*.
-   A link to your data source if it's not already in the caption.

Add appropriate alt text at the top of the chunk, in `fig-alt`. Then knit your Rmd, and hover over the image in your knitted html file to check out the alt text.

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Density plots of 3pm temperatures in 3 Australian locations."
#| fig-alt: "???"

ggplot(weather, aes(x = temp3pm, fill = location)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + 
  labs(x = "3pm temperature (Celsius)")  
```

\
\
\
\

#### Part b {.unnumbered}

Color is another important accessibility consideration. Let's check out the color accessibility of our density plot.

-   Run the `ggplot()` code from Part a in your console. The viz will pop up in the Plots tab.
-   In the Plots tab, click "Export" then "Save as image". Save the image somewhere.
-   Navigate to <https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/>
-   Above the image of crayons (I think it's crayons?), click "Choose file" and choose the plot file you just saved.
-   Click the various simulator buttons (eg: Red-Weak/Protanomaly) to check out how the colors in this plot might appear to others.
-   Summarize what you learn. What impact might our color choices have on one's ability to interpret the viz?

#### Part c {.unnumbered}

We can change our color schemes! There are many [color-blind friendly palettes in R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/colorBlindness/vignettes/colorBlindness.html). In the future, we'll set a default, more color-blind friendly color theme at the top of our Rmds. We can also do this individually for any plot that uses color. Run the chunks below to explore various options.

```{r}
ggplot(weather, aes(x = temp3pm, fill = location)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + 
  labs(x = "3pm temperature (Celsius)") + 
  scale_fill_viridis_d()    
```

```{r}
# In the color scale line:
# Change "fill" to "color" since we use color in the aes()
# Change "d" (discrete) to "c" (continuous) since maxtemp is on a continuous scale
ggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am, color = maxtemp)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + 
  labs(x = "3pm temperature (Celsius)") + 
  scale_color_viridis_c()
```

\
\
\
\

### Exercise 3: Ethics {.unnumbered}

Let's scratch the surface of ethics in data viz. Central to this discussion is the consideration of *impact*.

#### Part a {.unnumbered}

At a minimum, our data viz should not mislead. Reconsider the climate change example from above. Why is this plot unethical and what impact might it have on policy, public opinion, etc?

![](https://mac-stat.github.io/images/112/bad_viz/bad_viz_climate_change.png)

#### Part b {.unnumbered}

Again, data viz ethical considerations go beyond whether or not a plot is misleading. As described in the warm-up, we need to consider: visibility, privacy, power, emotion & embodiment, pluralism, & context. Depending upon the audience and goals of a data viz, addressing these points might require more nuance. Mainly, the viz tools we've learned are a great base or foundation, but aren't the only approaches to data viz. 

Pick one or more of the following examples of data viz to discuss with your group. How do the approaches taken:

-   emphasize one or more of: visibility, privacy, power, emotion, embodiment, pluralism, and/or context?
-   improve upon what we might be able to convey with a simpler bar chart, scatterplot, etc?

Example: **W.E.B. Du Bois (1868â€“1963)**

Du Bois ("Doo Boys") was a "sociologist, socialist, historian, civil rights activist, Pan-Africanist, author, writer, and editor"[^07-effective-viz-1]. He was also a *pioneer* in elevating emotion and embodiment in data visualization. For the Paris World Fair of 1900, Du Bois and his team of students from Atlanta University presented 60 data visualizations of the Black experience in America, less than 50 years after the abolishment of slavery. Du Bois noted: "I wanted to set down its aim and method in some outstanding way which would bring my work to notice by the thinking world." That is, he wanted to increase the impact of his work by partnering technical visualizations with design that better connects to lived experiences. NOTE: This work uses language common to that time period and addresses the topic of slavery. Check out:

### Exercise 4: Critique {.unnumbered}

Practice critiquing some more complicated data viz listed at [Modern Data Science with R, Exercise 2.5](http://mdsr-book.github.io/exercises.html#exercise_25).

Think about the following questions:

-   What story does the data graphic tell? What is the main message that you take away from it?
-   Can the data graphic be described in terms of the Grammar of Graphics (frame, glyphs, aesthetics, facet, scale, guide)? If so, please describe.
-   Critique and/or praise the visualization choices made by the designer. Do they work? Are they misleading? Thought-provoking? Are there things that you would have done differently?

### Exercise 5: Design Details {.unnumbered}

This final exercise is just "food for thought".  It's more of a discussion than an exercise, and gets into some of the finer design details and data viz theory. Go as deep or not deep as you'd like here.

In refining the details of our data viz, [Visualize This](https://www.amazon.com/Visualize-This-FlowingData-Visualization-Statistics/dp/0470944889/) and [Storytelling with Data](https://www.amazon.com/Storytelling-Data-Visualization-Business-Professionals/dp/1119002257) provide some of *their* guiding principles. But again, every context is different.

-   Put yourself in a reader's shoes. What parts of the data need explanation?
-   Shine a light on your data. Try to remove any "chart junk" that distracts from the data.
-   Vary color and style to emphasize the viz elements that are most important to the story you're telling.
-   It is easier to judge length than it is to judge area or angles.
-   Be thoughtful about how your categories are ordered for categorical data.

Getting into even more of the nitty gritty, we need to be mindful of what geometric elements and aesthetics we use. The following elements/aesthetics are listed in roughly descending order of human ability to perceive and compare nearby objects:[^07-effective-viz-2]

[^07-effective-viz-2]: B. S. Baumer, D. T. Kaplan, and N. J. Horton, *Modern Data Science with R*, 2017, p. 15.

1.  Position
2.  Length
3.  Angle
4.  Direction
5.  Shape (but only a very few different shapes)
6.  Area
7.  Volume
8.  Shade
9.  Color. (Color is the most difficult, because it is a 3-dimensional quantity.)

Finally, here are some facts to keep in mind about visual perception from [Now You See It](https://www.amazon.com/Now-You-See-Visualization-Quantitative/dp/0970601980).

#### Part a: Selectivity {.unnumbered}

Visual perception is selective, and our attention is often drawn to contrasts from the norm.

**Implication**: We should design visualizations so that the features we want to highlight stand out in contrast from those that are not worth the audience's attention.

**Example**: What stands out in this example image? This is originally from C. Ware, *Information Visualization: Perception for Design*, 2004? Source: S. Few, *Now You See It*, 2009, p. 33.

![](https://mac-stat.github.io/images/112/contrast.png)

#### Part b: Familiarity {.unnumbered}

Our eyes are drawn to familiar patterns. We observe what we know and expect.

**Implication**: Visualizations work best when they display information as patterns that familiar and easy to spot.

**Example**: Do you notice anything embedded in this rose image from coolbubble.com? Source: S. Few, *Now You See It*, 2009, p. 34.

#### Part c: Revisit {.unnumbered}

Revisit Part b. Do you notice anything in the shadows? Go to <https://mac-stat.github.io/images/112/rose2.png> for an image.
