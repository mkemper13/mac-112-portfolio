    "text": "Introduction\nThis is my online notebook for COMP/STAT112 course taken at Macalester College. Please, use the side bar on the left for navigation.\nSecond day of class. We learned how to render and push the changes to github. Most people in class are very confused.\n9/10 Just finished Homework 1 and got it submitted to GitHub. Finally think I got it to work. I am now going to do the reading for class tomorrow and then fill out the survey on the central form.\n9/16: Good reminder from this morning’s class: Box plots are constructed from five numbers - the minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum value of a quantitative variable.\n9/18: Just finished with Homework 2! Feeling pretty good about data visualization and creating plots.\n9/20: Working on in-class activity but I got this error message: “Downloading GitHub repo ropensci/rnaturalearthhires@HEAD” I think I have finally got the naturalearth package to load and then we ran out of time. I got all the way to exercise 6. About to go fill out the central form for this.\n10/1: Notes from Data Wrangling section:\nThe goals of Unit 2 are to explore how to:\nGet data into the tidy shape / format we need for analysis. For example, we might want to: keep only certain observations define new variables reformat or “clean” existing variables combine various datasets process “string” or text data Numerically (not just visually) explore and summarize various characteristics of the variables in our dataset.\n10/6:\nNotes from reading chapter 10 on how to group by proportions penguin_avg &lt;- penguins |&gt; group_by(species, sex) |&gt; summarize(avg_body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt; na.omit()\n10/7:\nMutate code for changing variable type:\nSubject is an integer and day is a character. We want them to be categorical (factor) and numeric, respectively.\nmutate(Subject = as.factor(Subject), day = as.numeric(day))",

    "text": "Exercises Part 2: Application\nThe remaining exercises are similar to some of those on the homework. Hence, the solutions are not provided. Let’s apply these ideas to the daily Birthdays dataset in the mosaic package.\n\nlibrary(mosaic)\n\nRegistered S3 method overwritten by 'mosaic':\n  method                           from   \n  fortify.SpatialPolygonsDataFrame ggplot2\n\n\n\nThe 'mosaic' package masks several functions from core packages in order to add \nadditional features.  The original behavior of these functions should not be affected by this.\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'mosaic'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:Matrix':\n\n    mean\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:dplyr':\n\n    count, do, tally\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n\n    cross\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:ggplot2':\n\n    stat\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    binom.test, cor, cor.test, cov, fivenum, IQR, median, prop.test,\n    quantile, sd, t.test, var\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    max, mean, min, prod, range, sample, sum\n\ndata(\"Birthdays\")\nhead(Birthdays)\n\n  state year month day       date wday births\n1    AK 1969     1   1 1969-01-01  Wed     14\n2    AL 1969     1   1 1969-01-01  Wed    174\n3    AR 1969     1   1 1969-01-01  Wed     78\n4    AZ 1969     1   1 1969-01-01  Wed     84\n5    CA 1969     1   1 1969-01-01  Wed    824\n6    CO 1969     1   1 1969-01-01  Wed    100\n\n\nBirthdays gives the number of births recorded on each day of the year in each state from 1969 to 19881. We can use our wrangling skills to understand some drivers of daily births. Putting these all together can be challenging! Remember the following ways to make tasks more manageable:\n\nTranslate the prompt into our 6 verbs (and count()). That is, think before you type.\nBuild your code line by line. It’s important to understand what’s being piped into each function!\n\n\nExercise 5: Warming up\n\n# How many days of data do we have for each state?\n\n\n# How many total births were there in this time period?\n\n\n# How many total births were there per state in this time period, sorted from low to high?\n\n\n\nExercise 6: Homework Reprise\nCreate a new dataset named daily_births that includes the total number of births per day (across all states) and the corresponding day of the week, eg, Mon. NOTE: Name the column with total births so that it’s easier to wrangle and plot.\nUsing this data, construct a plot of births over time, indicating the day of week.\n\n\nExercise 7: Wrangle & Plot\nFor each prompt below, you can decide whether you want to: (1) wrangle and store data, then plot; or (2) wrangle data and pipe directly into ggplot. For example:\n\npenguins |&gt; \n  filter(species != \"Gentoo\") |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(y = bill_length_mm, x = bill_depth_mm, color = species)) + \n    geom_point()\n\nWarning: Removed 1 row containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart a\nCalculate the total number of births in each month and year, eg, Jan 1969, Feb 1969, …. Label month by names not numbers, eg, Jan not 1. Then, plot the births by month and comment on what you learn.\n\n\nPart b\nIn 1988, calculate the total number of births per week in each state. Get rid of week “53”, which isn’t a complete week! Then, make a line plot of births by week for each state and comment on what you learn. For example, do you notice any seasonal trends? Are these the same in every state? Any outliers?\n\n\nPart c\nRepeat the above for just Minnesota (MN) and Louisiana (LA). MN has one of the coldest climates and LA has one of the warmest. How do their seasonal trends compare? Do you think these trends are similar in other colder and warmer states? Try it!\n\n\n\nExercise 8: More Practice\n\nPart a\nCreate a dataset with only births in Massachusetts (MA) in 1979 and sort the days from those with the most births to those with the fewest.\n\n\nPart b\nMake a table showing the five states with the most births between September 9, 1979 and September 12, 1979, including the 9th and 12th. Arrange the table in descending order of births.",
