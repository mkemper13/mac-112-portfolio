    "text": "Introduction\nThis is my online notebook for COMP/STAT112 course taken at Macalester College. Please, use the side bar on the left for navigation.\nSecond day of class. We learned how to render and push the changes to github. Most people in class are very confused.\n9/10 Just finished Homework 1 and got it submitted to GitHub. Finally think I got it to work. I am now going to do the reading for class tomorrow and then fill out the survey on the central form.\n9/16: Good reminder from this morning’s class: Box plots are constructed from five numbers - the minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum value of a quantitative variable.\n9/18: Just finished with Homework 2! Feeling pretty good about data visualization and creating plots.\n9/20: Working on in-class activity but I got this error message: “Downloading GitHub repo ropensci/rnaturalearthhires@HEAD” I think I have finally got the naturalearth package to load and then we ran out of time. I got all the way to exercise 6. About to go fill out the central form for this.\n10/1: Notes from Data Wrangling section:\nThe goals of Unit 2 are to explore how to:\nGet data into the tidy shape / format we need for analysis. For example, we might want to: keep only certain observations define new variables reformat or “clean” existing variables combine various datasets process “string” or text data Numerically (not just visually) explore and summarize various characteristics of the variables in our dataset.\n10/6:\nNotes from reading chapter 10 on how to group by proportions penguin_avg &lt;- penguins |&gt; group_by(species, sex) |&gt; summarize(avg_body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt; na.omit()\n10/7:\nMutate code for changing variable type:\nSubject is an integer and day is a character. We want them to be categorical (factor) and numeric, respectively.\nmutate(Subject = as.factor(Subject), day = as.numeric(day))",

We can use our wrangling skills to understand some drivers of daily births. Putting these all together can be challenging! Remember the following ways to make tasks more manageable:\n\nTranslate the prompt into our 6 verbs (and count()). That is, think before you type.\nBuild your code line by line. It’s important to understand what’s being piped into each function!\n\n\nExercise 5: Warming up\n\n# How many days of data do we have for each state?\n\n\n# How many total births were there in this time period?\n\n\n# How many total births were there per state in this time period, sorted from low to high?\n\n\n\nExercise 6: Homework Reprise\nCreate a new dataset named daily_births that includes the total number of births per day (across all states) and the corresponding day of the week, eg, Mon. NOTE: Name the column with total births so that it’s easier to wrangle and plot.\nUsing this data, construct a plot of births over time, indicating the day of week.\n\n\nExercise 7: Wrangle & Plot\nFor each prompt below, you can decide whether you want to: (1) wrangle and store data, then plot; or (2) wrangle data and pipe directly into ggplot. For example:\n\npenguins |&gt; \n  filter(species != \"Gentoo\") |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(y = bill_length_mm, x = bill_depth_mm, color = species)) + \n    geom_point()\n\nWarning: Removed 1 row containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart a\nCalculate the total number of births in each month and year, eg, Jan 1969, Feb 1969, …. Label month by names not numbers, eg, Jan not 1. Then, plot the births by month and comment on what you learn.\n\n\nPart b\nIn 1988, calculate the total number of births per week in each state. Get rid of week “53”, which isn’t a complete week! Then, make a line plot of births by week for each state and comment on what you learn. For example, do you notice any seasonal trends? Are these the same in every state? Any outliers?\n\n\nPart c\nRepeat the above for just Minnesota (MN) and Louisiana (LA). MN has one of the coldest climates and LA has one of the warmest. How do their seasonal trends compare? Do you think these trends are similar in other colder and warmer states? Try it!\n\n\n\nExercise 8: More Practice\n\nPart a\nCreate a dataset with only births in Massachusetts (MA) in 1979 and sort the days from those with the most births to those with the fewest.\n\n\nPart b\nMake a table showing the five states with the most births between September 9, 1979 and September 12, 1979, including the 9th and 12th. Arrange the table in descending order of births.",

Thus we have to specify these keys in our code:\n\nstudents_2 |&gt; \n  left_join(enrollments_2, by = c(\"class\" = \"course\"))\n\n  student    class enrollment\n1       D COMP 101         19\n2       E BIOL 101         20\n3       F POLI 101         NA\n\n\n\n# The order of the keys is important:\n# by = c(\"left data key\" = \"right data key\")\n# The order is mixed up here, thus we get an error:\nstudents_2 |&gt; \n  left_join(enrollments_2, by = c(\"course\" = \"class\"))\n\n\n\nPart c\nDefine another set of fake data which adds grade information:\n\n# Add student grades in each course\nstudents_3 &lt;- data.frame(\n  student = c(\"Y\", \"Y\", \"Z\", \"Z\"),\n  class = c(\"COMP 101\", \"BIOL 101\", \"POLI 101\", \"COMP 101\"),\n  grade = c(\"B\", \"S\", \"C\", \"A\")\n)\n\n# Check it out\nstudents_3\n\n  student    class grade\n1       Y COMP 101     B\n2       Y BIOL 101     S\n3       Z POLI 101     C\n4       Z COMP 101     A\n\n# Add average grades in each course\nenrollments_3 &lt;- data.frame(\n  class = c(\"ART 101\", \"BIOL 101\",\"COMP 101\"),\n  grade = c(\"B\", \"A\", \"A-\"),\n  enrollment = c(20, 18, 19)\n)\n\n# Check it out\nenrollments_3\n\n     class grade enrollment\n1  ART 101     B         20\n2 BIOL 101     A         18\n3 COMP 101    A-         19\n\n\nTry doing a left_join() to link the students’ classes to their enrollment info.

BUT grade is measuring 2 different things here: individual student grades in students_3 and average student grades in enrollments_3. Thus it doesn’t make sense to try to join the datasets with respect to this variable. We can again solve this by specifying that we want to join the datasets using the class variable or key. What are grade.x and grade.y?\n\nstudents_3 |&gt; \n  left_join(enrollments_3, by = c(\"class\" = \"class\"))\n\n  student    class grade.x grade.y enrollment\n1       Y COMP 101       B      A-         19\n2       Y BIOL 101       S       A         18\n3       Z POLI 101       C    &lt;NA&gt;         NA\n4       Z COMP 101       A      A-         19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2: More small practice\nBefore applying these ideas to bigger datasets, let’s practice identifying which join is appropriate in different scenarios. Define the following fake data on voters (people who have voted) and contact info for voting age adults (people who could vote):\n\n# People who have voted\nvoters &lt;- data.frame(\n  id = c(\"A\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\", \"G\"),\n  times_voted = c(2, 4, 17, 6, 20)\n)\n\nvoters\n\n  id times_voted\n1  A           2\n2  D           4\n3  E          17\n4  F           6\n5  G          20\n\n# Contact info for voting age adults\ncontact &lt;- data.frame(\n  name = c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\"),\n  address = c(\"summit\", \"grand\", \"snelling\", \"fairview\"),\n  age = c(24, 89, 43, 38)\n)\n\ncontact\n\n  name  address age\n1    A   summit  24\n2    B    grand  89\n3    C snelling  43\n4    D fairview  38\n\n\nUse the appropriate join for each prompt below. In each case, think before you type:\n\nWhat dataset goes on the left?\nWhat do you want the resulting dataset to look like? How many rows and columns will it have?\n\n\n# 1. We want contact info for people who HAVEN'T voted\ncontact %&gt;% \n  anti_join(voters, by = c(\"name\" = \"id\"))\n\n  name  address age\n1    B    grand  89\n2    C snelling  43\n\n# 2.

When possible, we want to add contact info to the voting roster\nvoters |&gt; \n  left_join(contact, by = c(\"id\" = \"name\"))\n\n  id times_voted  address age\n1  A           2   summit  24\n2  D           4 fairview  38\n3  E          17     &lt;NA&gt;  NA\n4  F           6     &lt;NA&gt;  NA\n5  G          20     &lt;NA&gt;  NA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3: Bigger datasets\nLet’s apply these ideas to some bigger datasets. In grades, each row is a student-class pair with information on:\n\nsid = student ID\ngrade = student’s grade\nsessionID = an identifier of the class section\n\n\n\n     sid grade   sessionID\n1 S31185    D+ session1784\n2 S31185    B+ session1785\n3 S31185    A- session1791\n4 S31185    B+ session1792\n5 S31185    B- session1794\n6 S31185    C+ session1795\n\n\nIn courses, each row corresponds to a class section with information on:\n\nsessionID = an identifier of the class section\ndept = department\nlevel = course level (eg: 100)\nsem = semester\nenroll = enrollment (number of students)\niid = instructor ID\n\n\n\n    sessionID dept level    sem enroll     iid\n1 session1784    M   100 FA1991     22 inst265\n2 session1785    k   100 FA1991     52 inst458\n3 session1791    J   100 FA1993     22 inst223\n4 session1792    J   300 FA1993     20 inst235\n5 session1794    J   200 FA1993     22 inst234\n6 session1795    J   200 SP1994     26 inst230\n\n\nUse R code to take a quick glance at the data.\n\n# How many observations (rows) and variables (columns) are there in the grades data?\ngrades%&gt;%\n  dim()\n\n[1] 5844    3\n\n# How many observations (rows) and variables (columns) are there in the courses data?\ncourses%&gt;%\n  dim()\n\n[1] 1718    6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4: Class size\nHow big are the classes?\n\nPart a\nBefore digging in, note that some courses are listed twice in the courses data:\n\ncourses |&gt; \n  count(sessionID) |&gt; \n  filter(n &gt; 1)\n\n     sessionID n\n1  session2047 2\n2  session2067 2\n3  session2448 2\n4  session2509 2\n5  session2541 2\n6  session2824 2\n7  session2826 2\n8  session2862 2\n9  session2897 2\n10 session3046 2\n11 session3057 2\n12 session3123 2\n13 session3243 2\n14 session3257 2\n15 session3387 2\n16 session3400 2\n17 session3414 2\n18 session3430 2\n19 session3489 2\n20 session3524 2\n21 session3629 2\n22 session3643 2\n23 session3821 2\n\n\nIf we pick out just 1 of these, we learn that some courses are cross-listed in multiple departments:\n\ncourses |&gt; \n  filter(sessionID == \"session2047\")\n\nFor our class size exploration, obtain the total enrollments in each sessionID, combining any cross-listed sections. Save this as courses_combined. NOTE: There’s no joining to do here!\n\n courses_combined &lt;- courses |&gt; \n   group_by(sessionID) |&gt; \n   summarize(enroll = sum(enroll))\n\n# Check that this has 1695 rows and 2 columns\n dim(courses_combined)\n\n[1] 1695    2\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nLet’s first examine the question of class size from the administration’s viewpoint. To this end, calculate the median class size across all class sections. (The median is the middle or 50th percentile. Unlike the mean, it’s not skewed by outliers.) THINK FIRST:\n\nWhich of the 2 datasets do you need to answer this question? One? Both?\nIf you need course information, use courses_combined not courses.\nDo you have to do any joining? If so, which dataset will go on the left, i.e. which dataset includes your primary observations of interest?

To get a sense for the typical student experience and range in student experiences, construct and discuss a histogram of the median class sizes experienced by the students.\n\n ggplot(student_class_size, aes(x = med_class)) + \n   geom_histogram(color = \"white\")\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`.

HINT: You’ll need to do multiple joins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 7: HOMEWORK PRACTICE\nThis exercise is on Homework 4, thus no solutions are provided. In Homework 4, you’ll be working with the Birthdays data:\n\nlibrary(mosaic)\n\nRegistered S3 method overwritten by 'mosaic':\n  method                           from   \n  fortify.SpatialPolygonsDataFrame ggplot2\n\n\n\nThe 'mosaic' package masks several functions from core packages in order to add \nadditional features.  The original behavior of these functions should not be affected by this.\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'mosaic'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:Matrix':\n\n    mean\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:dplyr':\n\n    count, do, tally\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n\n    cross\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:ggplot2':\n\n    stat\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    binom.test, cor, cor.test, cov, fivenum, IQR, median, prop.test,\n    quantile, sd, t.test, var\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    max, mean, min, prod, range, sample, sum\n\ndata(\"Birthdays\")\nhead(Birthdays)\n\n  state year month day       date wday births\n1    AK 1969     1   1 1969-01-01  Wed     14\n2    AL 1969     1   1 1969-01-01  Wed    174\n3    AR 1969     1   1 1969-01-01  Wed     78\n4    AZ 1969     1   1 1969-01-01  Wed     84\n5    CA 1969     1   1 1969-01-01  Wed    824\n6    CO 1969     1   1 1969-01-01  Wed    100\n\n\nYou’ll also be exploring how the number of daily births is (or isn’t!) related to holidays. To this end, import data on U.S. federal holidays here. NOTE: lubridate::dmy() converts the character-string date stored in the CSV to a “POSIX” date-number.\n\nholidays &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/US-Holidays.csv\") |&gt;\n  mutate(date = as.POSIXct(lubridate::dmy(date)))\n\n\nPart a\nCreate a new dataset, daily_births_1980, which:\n\nkeeps only daily_births related to 1980\nadds a variable called is_holiday which is TRUE when the day is a holiday, and FALSE otherwise. NOTE: !is.na(x) is TRUE if column x is not NA, and FALSE if it is NA.\n\nPrint out the first 6 rows and confirm that your dataset has 366 rows (1 per day in 1980) and 7 columns. HINT: You’ll need to combine 2 different datasets.\n\n# Define daily_births_1980\n\n\n# Check out the first 6 rows\n\n\n# Confirm that daily_births_1980 has 366 rows and 7 columns\n\n\n\nPart b\nPlot the total number of babies born (y-axis) per day (x-axis) in 1980. Color each date according to its day of the week, and shape each date according to whether or not it’s a holiday. (This is a modified version of 3c!)\n\n\nPart c\nDiscuss your observations. For example: To what degree does the theory that there tend to be fewer births on holidays hold up? What holidays stand out the most?\n\n\nPart d (OPTIONAL)\nSome holidays stand out more than others. It would be helpful to label them. Use geom_text to add labels to each of the holidays. NOTE: You can set the orientation of a label with the angle argument; e.g., geom_text(angle = 40, ...).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext steps\nIf you finish this all during class, you’re expected to work on Homework 4. If you’re done with Homework 4, you’re expected to play around with more TidyTuesday data. Mainly, and naturally, you’re expected to spend 112 class time on 112 :)",

Let’s get the data ready for that analysis here. Make the following changes to the courses_clean data. Because they have different enrollment structures, and we don’t want to compare apples and oranges, remove the following:\n\nall sections in PE and INTD (interdisciplinary studies courses)\nall music ensembles and dance practicums, i.e. all MUSI and THDA classes with numbers less than 100. HINT: !(dept == \"MUSI\" & as.numeric(number) &lt; 100)\nall lab sections. Be careful which variable you use here. For example, you don’t want to search by “Lab” and accidentally eliminate courses with words such as “Labor”.\n\nSave the results as enrollments (don’t overwrite courses_clean).\n\nenrollments &lt;- courses_clean%&gt;%\n  filter(dept != \"PE\", dept != \"INTD\")%&gt;%\n  filter(!(dept == \"MUSI\" & as.numeric(number) &lt; 100))%&gt;%\n  filter(!(dept == \"THDA\" & as.numeric(number) &lt; 100))%&gt;%\n  filter(!str_detect(section, \"L\"))\n\nhead(enrollments)\n\n  dept number section   crn                                                name\n1 AMST    112      01 10318         Introduction to African American Literature\n2 AMST    194      01 10073              Introduction to Asian American Studies\n3 AMST    194      F1 10072 What’s After White Empire - And Is It Already Here?\n4 AMST    203      01 10646 Politics and Inequality: The American Welfare State\n5 AMST    205      01 10842                         Trans Theories and Politics\n6 AMST    209      01 10474                   Civil Rights in the United States\n   days            time      room             instructor avail max enroll\n1 M W F 9:40 - 10:40 am  MAIN 009       Daylanne English     3  20     17\n2 M W F  1:10 - 2:10 pm MUSIC 219          Jake Nagasawa    -4  16     20\n3  T R   3:00 - 4:30 pm   HUM 214 Karin Aguilar-San Juan     0  14     14\n4 M W F 9:40 - 10:40 am  CARN 305          Lesley Lavery     3  25     22\n5  T R   3:00 - 4:30 pm  MAIN 009              Myrl Beam    -2  20     22\n6   W   7:00 - 10:00 pm  MAIN 010         Walter Greason    -1  15     16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6: Enrollment & departments\nExplore enrollments by department. You decide what research questions to focus on. Use both visual and numerical summaries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 7: Enrollment & faculty\nLet’s now explore enrollments by instructor. In doing so, we have to be cautious of cross-listed courses that are listed under multiple different departments. Uncomment the code lines in the chunk below for an example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommenting/Uncommenting Code\n\n\n\nTo comment/uncomment several lines of code at once, highlight them then click ctrl/cmd+shift+c.\n\n\n\n enrollments |&gt;\n   filter(dept %in% c(\"STAT\", \"COMP\"), number == 112, section == \"01\")\n\n  dept number section   crn                         name  days           time\n1 COMP    112      01 10248 Introduction to Data Science  T R  3:00 - 4:30 pm\n2 STAT    112      01 10249 Introduction to Data Science  T R  3:00 - 4:30 pm\n      room        instructor avail max enroll\n1 OLRI 254 Brianna Heggeseth     1  28     27\n2 OLRI 254 Brianna Heggeseth     1  28     27\n\n\nNotice that these are the exact same section! In order to not double count an instructor’s enrollments, we can keep only the courses that have distinct() combinations of days, time, instructor values. Uncomment the code lines in the chunk below.\n\n enrollments_2 &lt;- enrollments |&gt; \n   distinct(days, time, instructor, .keep_all = TRUE)\n\n# NOTE: By default this keeps the first department alphabetically\n# That's fine because we won't use this to analyze department enrollments!\n# enrollments_2 |&gt; \n#   filter(instructor == \"Brianna Heggeseth\", name == \"Introduction to Data Science\")\n\nNow, explore enrollments by instructor. You decide what research questions to focus on. Use both visual and numerical summaries.\nCAVEAT: The above code doesn’t deal with co-taught courses that have more than one instructor. Thus instructors that co-taught are recorded as a pair, and their co-taught enrollments aren’t added to their total enrollments. This is tough to get around with how the data were scraped as the instructor names are smushed together, not separated by a comma!",
