# Introduction {.unnumbered}

This is my online notebook for COMP/STAT112 course taken at [Macalester College](https://www.macalester.edu/).  Please, use the side bar on the left for navigation.

Second day of class. We learned how to render and push the changes to github. Most people in class are very confused.
